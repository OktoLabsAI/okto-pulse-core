"""Production rebuild step adapter for KG-02 (bug b4c6920c).

Wires the KG-02 rebuild service to the existing consolidation pipeline
without reimplementing materialization. Strategy is **enqueue-then-wake**:

1. The rebuild service holds the KG-01 admin single-writer lock.
2. This adapter receives the source set already enumerated by
   :class:`BoardSourceStore` (KG-02.2 ``RebuildSourceEnumerator`` passes
   it forward through ``sources_payload``).
3. For each source row we UPSERT into ``ConsolidationQueue`` with the
   same dedup semantics as ``ConsolidationEnqueuer`` (insert if new,
   reset terminal rows to pending, leave pending/claimed alone). Rows use
   high priority because explicit recovery must not sit behind unrelated
   corrupt-board backlog.
4. We signal the consolidation worker so it picks up the new rows
   without waiting for its heartbeat.
5. The structural_hash / source_hash come from KG-02.5
   ``DeterministicStructuralRebuilder`` over the same source set so the
   rebuild report carries a deterministic receipt.

Trade-off documented:
* The adapter returns ``ok=True`` as soon as the rows are enqueued.
  Actual KG mutation happens asynchronously inside the consolidation
  worker (which has its own per-board commit lock that nests safely
  inside the KG-01 admin lock — the existing worker already serialises
  board-by-board). For E2E we expose a ``drain_until_idle`` helper that
  can be wired by callers that want synchronous wait-until-done
  semantics.
* The adapter uses stdlib ``sqlite3`` for the UPSERT because the KG-01
  ``rebuild_step_adapter`` callable is synchronous. The same SQLite
  file is shared with the async SQLAlchemy engine; readers and writers
  are serialised by SQLite's own file-level locks.

        PROGRESS-AWARE (campo 2026-06-10): ``timeout_seconds`` é a janela
        de ESTAGNAÇÃO, não o teto total. Cada vez que a profundidade da
        fila cai abaixo do menor valor já visto (o worker drenou pelo
        menos uma entry), a janela renova. Um board grande drenando
        devagar NÃO falha mais por teto fixo — antes, 520 sources a
        ~6 entries/min estouravam os 900s, o rebuild reportava
        queue_drain_timeout, a generation não promovia e o cognitive
        pending nunca materializava, embora o worker completasse o grafo
        em background minutos depois (grafo saudável, zero badges).
        ``hard_timeout_seconds`` continua como teto absoluto de segurança
        contra um produtor que re-enfileira para sempre.

        A small final grace window avoids a false failed rebuild when
        the queue is nearly drained at the stall deadline. The Pulse SaaS
        E2E rebuild exposed that failure mode: the run timed out with
        four rows still visible, then the worker finished seconds later,
        leaving a healthy graph but no promoted generation. The grace is
        bounded and only applies while the remaining depth is below the
        configured threshold, so a genuinely stuck large backlog still
        fails closed."""
