"""Real chaos executor for KG destructive stress profile (KG-01.6 FR8).

This module wires the canonical chaos modes against the KG-01.1-5
primitives (single-writer lock, backpressure gate, quarantine service,
safe write lifecycle, write barrier). It is the executor that CI plugs
into ``KGStressProfileRunner`` so that release evidence is produced by
exercising real code paths — not the no-op default.

Each ``ChaosMode`` validates one invariant of the hardening surface:

* ``memory_pressure``: feed the buffer high-water-mark close to/above
  the 90 % threshold and confirm the health classifier escalates to
  ``at_risk`` BEFORE any storage degradation; release-clean iff no
  spurious ``corruption_detected`` is reported.
* ``sigkill_during_write``: simulate a worker that crashed mid-write —
  acquired the single-writer lock, started the safe lifecycle, never
  released. Verify the lock's TTL-based stale recovery path reclaims
  cleanly and NO primary file is overwritten by a racing recoverer.
* ``oom_during_write``: simulate allocation failure inside the safe
  lifecycle. The lifecycle MUST return ``status=FAILED`` with the
  failing step bucketed, and NO partial write may bypass the barrier.
* ``restart_during_consolidation``: simulate the orchestrator dying
  between commit and outbox flush. Bootstrap on restart MUST go
  through ``purge_*_storage`` which is quarantine-first — no purge
  may happen without a manifest.
* ``tick_consolidation_rebuild_concurrency``: 3 actors contend for
  the lock simultaneously (tick worker, consolidation worker, rebuild
  admin lane). Exactly ONE wins the lock; the rebuild admin lane
  must drain (not bypass) and the other two must report contention.

All scenarios are deterministic — they do NOT depend on RNG, wall
clock or external storage. The fakes provided here exercise the
primitives' public APIs directly so the runner's pass/fail signal
is a true measurement of the hardening surface's contracts.
