# Tool docs — `kg`

Full long-form documentation (args, returns, examples, enum prose) for `okto_pulse_*` tools in this family. The `tools/list` surface carries only the compact summary; read here on demand.

## `okto_pulse_kg_abort_consolidation`

Drop an in-flight session without committing.

No compensating delete is applied — commit was never called, so the embedded graph database
has no partial writes. The session is marked aborted and removed from
the in-memory registry.

Args:
    session_id: Session from begin_consolidation
    reason: Optional reason (logged for audit)

Returns:
    JSON with session_id, status=aborted

## `okto_pulse_kg_add_edge_candidate`

Add an edge candidate to an open session.

Endpoints (from_candidate_id / to_candidate_id) must reference either
another in-session node candidate OR an existing graph database node via the
'kg:' prefix (kg:decision_abc123).

Cognitive agents may only propose judgement edges: supersedes,
contradicts, depends_on, relates_to, validates. Deterministic edges
such as implements, tests, belongs_to, mentions, violates, and
derives_from are reserved for the Layer 1 worker and are rejected with
layer_violation. Endpoint pairs are strict: Decision->Decision for
supersedes/contradicts/depends_on, Decision->Alternative for
relates_to, and Learning->Bug for validates.

Args:
    session_id: Session from begin_consolidation
    candidate: Dict with candidate_id, edge_type, from/to, confidence

Returns:
    JSON with accepted=true and edge_count_in_session

## `okto_pulse_kg_add_node_candidate`

Add a node candidate to an open consolidation session.

The candidate stays in-memory until commit_consolidation or expiry.
candidate_id must be unique within the session.

**Writer-path ownership (allowlist):** the cognitive consolidation path may only create
`Decision`, `Learning`, `Alternative`, `Assumption`. `Criterion` (from acceptance
criteria) and `Constraint` (from technical requirements / business rules) are
**deterministic-only** — materialized by the deterministic worker, not by this tool.
Reference an existing deterministic `Criterion`/`Constraint` node by id (or wait for the
deterministic worker); do not recreate it on the cognitive path. A `Criterion`/`Constraint`
candidate proposed here is rejected **before any graph mutation** with
`status=source_type_not_supported`, `reason=writer_not_connectivity_owner` (distinct from a
missing-connectivity failure); remediation: remove the candidate, abort/recreate the
session without it, or route through the deterministic owner.

For cognitive closeout, create a `Decision` only when the source artifact
contains a real choice and you can add a valid judgement edge for it. Do not add
an artificial Decision to satisfy connectivity. If the closeout only captures
uncertainty, rejected paths, risks, or contextual notes, prefer `Assumption` or
`Alternative` and include a precise `source_artifact_ref` such as
`spec:<spec_id>:assumption:<stable_id>` or
`spec:<spec_id>:alternative:<stable_id>`.

Args:
    session_id: Session from begin_consolidation
    candidate: Dict with candidate_id, node_type, title, content, etc.

Returns:
    JSON with accepted=true and node_count_in_session

## `okto_pulse_kg_begin_consolidation`

Open a transactional consolidation session against a board.

Computes SHA256(board + artifact + content) for nothing-changed detection.
Returns a session_id the agent uses in all subsequent primitives. The
session has a TTL (default 1h, configurable via kg_session_ttl_seconds)
and is owned exclusively by the authenticated agent.

Args:
    board_id: Target board
    artifact_type: spec | sprint | qa | etc.
    artifact_id: Source artifact id
    raw_content: Full artifact content used for SHA256 dedup
    deterministic_candidates: Pre-extracted node candidates (ORNs, refs)

Returns:
    JSON with session_id, content_hash, nothing_changed flag, expires_at

## `okto_pulse_kg_commit_consolidation`

Atomically commit the session: graph database writes + audit row + outbox event.

agent_overrides map candidate_id → ReconciliationHint for cases where
the agent's semantic reasoning produces a different op than the
server's deterministic default.

Args:
    session_id: Session from begin_consolidation
    summary_text: Optional session summary (surfaced in dashboard)
    agent_overrides: Optional per-candidate hint overrides

Returns:
    JSON with session_id, status=committed, counts, committed_at

## `okto_pulse_kg_canonical_debt_list`

List canonical-debt ledger rows for a board.

Use this when `okto_pulse_kg_health` reports `canonical_debt.open_count > 0`
and an agent needs to inspect which artifacts are pending, blocked, failed,
or retry-scheduled. The tool is read-only and mirrors the REST canonical-debt
list projection.

Args:
    board_id: Board UUID.
    artifact_type: Optional filter such as `spec`, `task`, `test`, or `bug`.
    state: Optional canonical_state filter such as `pending`, `failed`,
        `blocked`, or `retry_scheduled`.
    limit: Max rows to return (1-200, default 50).
    offset: Skip first N rows (>=0, default 0).

Returns:
    JSON `{board_id, items, counts, total, limit, offset}`. Each item includes
    artifact identity, source_ref, target_status, canonical_state, failure
    reason, last_error, retry metadata, queue/DLQ refs, and evidence_ref.

## `okto_pulse_kg_canonical_partition_integrity_list`

List canonical/working partition integrity issues for a board.

Use this when KG health reports partition drift or when validating that working
nodes have not leaked into canonical-only surfaces.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID.
    limit: Max rows to return.
    offset: Page offset.

Returns:
    JSON with partition issue rows and bounded counts.

## `okto_pulse_kg_originates_from_contract_audit`

Read-only advisory audit for persisted `originates_from` KG edges whose endpoint
labels violate the Bug->Entity contract.

Use this when validating historical KG hygiene. Known endpoint pairs outside
Bug->Entity are returned as high-confidence advisory findings; missing endpoint
types are returned as low-confidence warnings. The tool never mutates, rebuilds,
reprocesses, skips, or remediates graph data.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID.
    limit: Max findings to return (1-200, default 50).
    offset: Page offset.
    include_ok: Include contract-satisfying edges in `items` when true.

Returns:
    JSON `{board_id, relationship_type, contract, status, items, counts, total,
    scanned, limit, offset, read_only, mutated}`. Each item includes relationship
    id, source/target ids, known endpoint types, classification, confidence,
    reason, path, and `mutated=false`.

## `okto_pulse_kg_dead_letter_list`

List dead-lettered consolidation rows.

Use this when `okto_pulse_kg_health` reports `dead_letter_count > 0`
and you need to inspect which artifacts failed, what error repeated, and
how many attempts were made. Each row includes the full `errors` array:
one entry per attempt with error_type, message, occurred_at, and optional
traceback.

After fixing the root cause (schema migration, WAL recovery, code fix, or
transient lock contention), call `okto_pulse_kg_dead_letter_reprocess` to
move selected rows back to the consolidation queue.

Args:
    board_id: Board UUID
    limit: Max rows to return (1-200, default 50)
    offset: Skip first N rows (>=0, default 0)

Returns:
    JSON `{rows, total, limit, offset}` on success. `{error: "..."}`
    on auth or permission failure.

## `okto_pulse_kg_dead_letter_reprocess`

okto_pulse_kg_dead_letter_reprocess — requeue dead-lettered KG
consolidation rows after the root cause is fixed.

Use this after `okto_pulse_kg_migrate_schema`, WAL recovery, or a code fix
when DLQ rows should be retried. The tool is idempotent: if a matching
pending queue row already exists for the same board/artifact, it resets that
row and removes the DLQ entry instead of creating duplicates.

Args:
    board_id: Board UUID.
    dead_letter_ids: Optional multi-value DLQ row IDs. Use a native list,
        JSON array string, or pipe-separated string. Empty means "oldest
        rows for this board up to limit".
    limit: Max DLQ rows to requeue (1-200, default 50).
    process_now: "true" to immediately run one consolidation worker batch
        after requeueing; "false" to only mark rows pending.

Returns:
    JSON with selected/requeued/already_queued counts and, when
    process_now is true, the worker batch processed count.

## `okto_pulse_kg_connectivity_dlq_diagnose`

Diagnose the LIVE connectivity-guard `technical_dlq` class (RKG-04) before any
reprocess. Read-only.

The class is every dead-letter row whose terminal error is `KG node
connectivity guard rejected the commit before graph mutation` (the recurring
cognitive-closeout failure that RKG-02 fixes at the root). Returns each member's
`dead_letter_id`, `artifact_id`, `attempts`, `errors`, `last_error`, the
`source_artifact_ref` involved, the `probable_root_cause`, the `next_action` and
a `remediation` hint — the input you must feed to
`okto_pulse_kg_connectivity_dlq_reprocess`, which only accepts in-class ids.

Args:
    board_id: Board UUID.

Returns:
    JSON `{board_id, dlq_class, count, items, dead_letter_ids}`.

## `okto_pulse_kg_connectivity_dlq_reprocess`

Fail-closed reprocess of the connectivity-guard `technical_dlq` class (RKG-04).

Unlike the generic `okto_pulse_kg_dead_letter_reprocess`, this NEVER does a broad
reprocess: it requires EXPLICIT in-class `dead_letter_ids` (from
`okto_pulse_kg_connectivity_dlq_diagnose`) and blocks — removing NO DLQ — when the
selection is empty (`no_dlq_selected`), missing (`selected_dlq_missing`),
out-of-class (`selected_dlq_out_of_class`), the RKG-02/RKG-03 root-cause fixes are
absent (`rkg02_rkg03_not_applied`) or the KG is quarantined (`kg_quarantined`). On
success it reuses the idempotent DLQ→ConsolidationQueue path (queue dedup).

Args:
    board_id: Board UUID.
    dead_letter_ids: REQUIRED in-class DLQ row IDs (native list, JSON array
        string, or pipe-separated string). Empty is blocked, never "all".
    process_now: "true" to run one consolidation worker batch after requeueing.

Returns:
    JSON. When blocked: `{success: false, blocked: true, removed_dlq: false,
    reasons, preconditions}`. On success: selected/requeued/already_queued counts
    + optional worker batch info.

## `okto_pulse_kg_connectivity_dlq_verify`

After the consolidation worker drains the queue, confirm the connectivity-guard
class is cleared for the given `artifact_refs` (or the whole class when empty).
Read-only. A member that returned to the DLQ stays VISIBLE
(`class_cleared=false` + `remaining_dlq`) — partial success is never masked.

Args:
    board_id: Board UUID.
    artifact_refs: Optional `type:id` refs to scope the check (native list, JSON
        array string, or pipe-separated string). Empty checks the whole class.

Returns:
    JSON `{class_cleared, remaining_count, remaining_dlq}`.

## `okto_pulse_kg_health_readiness`

Canonical NON-MASKABLE health/readiness projection (RKG-05; gemelar do REST
`GET /api/v1/kg/health-readiness`). The single source the health/readiness/MCP/UI/
report surfaces share, so a technical blocker is never hidden by a summary view or
a cognitive skip.

Both `profile=summary` and `profile=full` expose:
- `technical_signals` — scalar counters `dead_letter_count`, `technical_dlq_count`,
  `canonical_debt_open_count`, `active_queue_count`. These are SEPARATE
  operational domains: one count is never inferred from another (e.g.
  `active_queue_count` is not derived from `dead_letter_count`).
- `readiness` — `blocking` (a technical problem IS visible) vs `would_block_done`
  (whether the gate would actually block; `false` under advisory enforcement),
  plus `reasons` and `policy_reason`.
- top-level `cognitive_enforcement_mode` (`advisory`/`blocking`) and
  `enforcement_active`.
- `non_maskable_items` — one entry per OPEN technical item with `artifact_ref`,
  `source_ref`, `signal`, `last_error`, `error_text`, `next_action`,
  `remediation` and `drill_down_tool`. A cognitive skip/no_action can never
  reduce this list (it is derived from health, not from the cognitive verdict).

`profile=full` ADDS the prose `health_issues` + `root_cause`. An invalid profile
returns `invalid_profile` (HTTP 400 on REST). Optional `artifact_ref` scopes
`non_maskable_items`.

Args:
    board_id: Board UUID.
    profile: "summary" (default) or "full".
    artifact_ref: Optional `type:id` ref to scope `non_maskable_items`.

Returns:
    JSON `{board_id, profile, overall_state, cognitive_enforcement_mode,
    enforcement_active, technical_signals, readiness, non_maskable_items,
    operational_domains, [health_issues, root_cause]}`.

## `okto_pulse_kg_explain_constraint`

Explain the origin of a constraint: the spec/decision it derives from,
related constraints, and any violations (bugs) registered against it.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID
    constraint_id: Constraint node ID

Returns:
    JSON with constraint details, origins, and violations

## `okto_pulse_kg_find_contradictions`

Find contradictory decision pairs via :contradicts relationship.
When node_id is provided, returns only pairs involving that node.
Without node_id, returns all contradiction pairs (limit 50).

Args:
    board_id: Board ID
    node_id: Optional Decision node ID (empty = all pairs)
    max_rows: Maximum pairs (default 50)

Returns:
    JSON with pairs: [{id_a, title_a, id_b, title_b, confidence}]

## `okto_pulse_kg_find_similar_decisions`

Find decisions similar to a topic using hybrid ranking:
0.5*semantic + 0.2*graph_centrality + 0.2*recency + 0.1*confidence.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID
    topic: Natural language description to match against
    top_k: Maximum results (default 10)
    min_similarity: Minimum similarity threshold (default 0.3)

Returns:
    JSON with decisions ordered by combined_score DESC

## `okto_pulse_kg_get_decision_history`

Trace decisions about a topic/module over time. Returns decisions
matching the topic with their supersedence chain.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID
    topic: Topic or keyword to search for. Accepts natural-language
        phrases when ``use_semantic=True`` (paraphrases like
        "cache strategy" vs "caching approach" surface related hits).
    min_confidence: Minimum confidence threshold (default 0.5)
    max_rows: Maximum results (default 100)
    use_semantic: When True (default), embed the topic and query the
        Decision HNSW index first, then backfill with title-CONTAINS
        matches. Set False for deterministic string-only search.
    min_similarity: Cosine similarity floor for semantic hits
        (default 0.3; range 0.0–1.0).

Returns:
    JSON with decisions list. Semantic hits are ordered by similarity
    (best first); title-CONTAINS fallbacks retain relevance_score
    ordering.

## `okto_pulse_kg_get_learning_from_bugs`

Get lessons learned from bugs in a specific area. Returns Learning
nodes connected to Bug nodes via :validates relationship.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID
    area: Area keyword to filter bugs by (matches title/content)
    min_confidence: Minimum confidence (default 0.5)
    max_rows: Maximum results (default 100)

Returns:
    JSON with learnings: [{learning_id, learning_title, bug_id, bug_title}]

## `okto_pulse_kg_get_related_context`

Given an artifact, return its neighborhood in the KG: prior
decisions, applicable criteria, similar bugs, discarded alternatives.
Supports impact-analysis filters so an agent can scope traversal to
a specific edge set or direction.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID
    artifact_id: Source artifact reference (source_artifact_ref)
    min_confidence: Minimum confidence (default 0.5)
    max_rows: Maximum results (default 100)
    rel_types: Comma- or pipe-separated edge types to restrict the
        first hop (e.g. ``"supersedes,contradicts"`` or
        ``"tests|relates_to"``). Empty = any type.
    direction: ``"both"`` (default), ``"outgoing"``, or ``"incoming"``.
        Applied to hop1 only; hop2 is always undirected.
    max_depth: ``1`` returns center+hop1 only (hop2 fields null);
        ``2`` (default) returns the full 2-hop context.

Returns:
    JSON with 2-hop neighborhood context

## `okto_pulse_kg_get_similar_nodes`

Fetch existing graph database nodes similar to an in-session candidate.

MVP uses title-prefix match as a deterministic fallback; production
replaces with HNSW k-NN via vector index (card 00dae72a).

Args:
    session_id: Session from begin_consolidation
    candidate_id: Candidate to compare against
    top_k: Max neighbors (1-50, default 5)
    min_similarity: Threshold (0.0-1.0, default 0.3)

Returns:
    JSON with similar: [SimilarNode]

## `okto_pulse_kg_get_supersedence_chain`

Trace what superseded what for a specific decision. Returns the
chain of superseded decisions up to depth 10.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID
    decision_id: Decision node ID to trace from

Returns:
    JSON with chain, depth, current_active

## `okto_pulse_kg_health`

Snapshot of the KG health for one board — gemelar do REST GET /api/v1/kg/health.

Returns a SLIM operational view by default (profile=summary): the stop-rule
fields an agent needs before a KG mutation — graph_state, discovery_state,
overall_state, metric_status, classification_reason, correlation_id,
memory_pressure_status, recent_events — plus a few operational scalars
(queue_depth, dead_letter_count, total_nodes, default_score_ratio,
avg_relevance, contradict_warn_count, last_tick_status),
decay_scheduler_diagnostics, and storage_footprint_proxy. Scheduler debt is
operational debt and does not by itself require graph recovery. Verbose
diagnostics, state aliases and prose issue descriptions are omitted; pass
profile=full (or legacy) to get the complete dashboard payload.

Use it before kicking off long consolidations (high queue_depth means
your enqueue may sit pending), after flagging contradictions (spike in
contradict_warn_count = curator should reconcile), or to debug flat
ranking (default_score_ratio > 0.7 = scoring not differentiating).

Args:
    board_id: Board ID (uuid)
    profile: "summary" (default, slim) or "full"/"legacy" (all diagnostics).

Returns:
    JSON health snapshot, or {"error": "..."} on auth/not-found.

## `okto_pulse_kg_digest_layer_mismatch_list`

List nodes whose digest/materialization layer metadata is inconsistent.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID.
    limit: Max rows to return.
    offset: Page offset.

Returns:
    JSON with mismatch rows, expected/actual layer fields, and counts.

## `okto_pulse_kg_stale_canonical_parity_list`

List canonical nodes whose parity with working/source materialization is stale.

Use this after migrations or rebuilds to inspect stale canonical parity without
mutating the graph.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID.
    limit: Max rows to return.
    offset: Page offset.

Returns:
    JSON with stale parity rows and diagnostic metadata.

## `okto_pulse_kg_orphan_report`

Return a bounded safe orphan-node report for a board KG.

The payload intentionally exposes safe identifiers and aggregate diagnostics
only: board_id, generation_id, orphan counts, safe samples, unresolved reasons,
backfill summary, and correlation_id. It does not return raw node text,
embeddings, prompts, or payload bodies.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID.
    generation_id: Optional KG generation id.
    limit: Max safe sample count, clamped by the server.

Returns:
    JSON safe orphan report, or a structured graph-unavailable payload.

## `okto_pulse_kg_orphan_backfill`

Run explicit orphan backfill for structurally resolvable nodes.

Defaults to dry_run=true. The tool refuses writes when KG Health is
`recovery_needed` or `quarantined`, so operators use the recovery flow instead
of mutating a degraded graph.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID.
    generation_id: Optional KG generation id.
    dry_run: true to preview, false to write resolvable edges.
    node_ids: Optional multi-value node IDs as a native list, JSON array, or
        pipe-separated string.
    limit: Max nodes to inspect, clamped by the server.

Returns:
    JSON backfill summary with dry_run, detected, connected, unresolved,
    ambiguous, semantic_pending, and correlation_id.

## `okto_pulse_kg_list_alternatives`

List alternatives that were considered and discarded for a decision,
including their reason_discarded from the narrative.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID
    decision_id: Decision node ID
    max_rows: Maximum results (default 100)

Returns:
    JSON with alternatives list

## `okto_pulse_kg_list_cognitive_pending_items`

KG-03.2 — List cognitive pending items by board + generation.

Implements api_ae3a932a:

    request: board_id, kg_generation_id?, status?, limit?, offset?
    response (success): board_id, selected_kg_generation_id,
                        legacy_mode, counts, items
    errors: unauthorized | invalid_status | generation_not_found

Resolves to the latest recorded generation when ``kg_generation_id``
is omitted. When ``kg_generation_id`` is explicitly provided and
the record does not exist, returns a typed ``generation_not_found``
error (Codex audit val_ead80fbd).

Items use a strict API projection (``project_item_for_api``) that
exposes only the contract-defined fields. Storage-only fields
(board_id, kg_generation_id, event_ref, free-text ``reason``) are
never echoed.

Args:
    board_id: Target board id (required, non-empty).
    kg_generation_id: Optional KG generation UUID v4. When omitted
        the store's ``latest_generation(board_id)`` is used.
    status: Optional status filter from the bounded enum
        {pending, in_progress, consolidated, skipped, failed}.
    limit: Page size, 1..200, default 100.
    offset: Page offset, ≥ 0, default 0.
    status_filter: Deprecated compatibility alias for ``status``;
    ``status`` takes precedence when both are provided.

## `okto_pulse_kg_list_cognitive_readiness_items`

List cognitive-readiness items that can block completion or validation.

Use this to inspect outstanding cognitive closeout work before advancing a bug,
spec, or refinement through a gate.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID.
    entity_type: Optional source entity type filter.
    entity_id: Optional source entity ID filter.
    status: Optional readiness status filter.
    limit: Max rows.
    offset: Page offset.

Returns:
    JSON with readiness items, counts, and source references.

## `okto_pulse_kg_evaluate_cognitive_readiness`

Evaluate cognitive-readiness gates for a target entity.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID.
    entity_type: Target entity type.
    entity_id: Target entity ID.

Returns:
    JSON with readiness outcome, blockers, skip state, and remediation text.

## `okto_pulse_kg_evaluate_bug_cognitive_closure`

Evaluate whether a bug has the required cognitive closeout before closure.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID.
    bug_id: Bug card ID.

Returns:
    JSON with closure readiness, missing cognitive items, and gate outcome.

## `okto_pulse_kg_record_cognitive_skip`

Record a human-authorized cognitive-readiness skip.

This tool records the skip and its bounded reason. It must not be used as a
silent bypass for technical blockers.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID.
    entity_type: Target entity type.
    entity_id: Target entity ID.
    reason: Required justification.

Returns:
    JSON with recorded skip state and audit metadata.

## `okto_pulse_kg_clear_cognitive_skip`

Clear a previously recorded cognitive-readiness skip.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID.
    entity_type: Target entity type.
    entity_id: Target entity ID.
    reason: Optional audit reason.

Returns:
    JSON with updated readiness/skip state.

## `okto_pulse_kg_list_cognitive_dlq`

List cognitive-readiness dead-letter or failed extraction items.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID.
    limit: Max rows.
    offset: Page offset.

Returns:
    JSON with cognitive DLQ rows, error reason codes, and counts.

## `okto_pulse_kg_queue_drilldown`

Inspect active KG queue depth and per-state work distribution.

Use this when KG health reports backlog, at_risk, or backpressure and the agent
needs to distinguish active queue work from DLQ/debt.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID.
    profile: summary or full.

Returns:
    JSON with active queue counts, dead-letter counts, and queue diagnostics.

## `okto_pulse_kg_migrate_schema`

Force-apply schema migrations to fix legacy boards (board pre v0.3.2)
— gemelar do REST POST /api/v1/kg/{board_id}/migrate-schema.

Use quando consolidation falha com `Binder exception: Cannot find
property X for n` — geralmente significa que ALTER ADD para schema
column foi missed em board bootstrapped antes daquela versão.

Idempotente: re-rodar em board já migrado retorna `migrated=true`
com `columns_added` vazio (no-op).

NUNCA delete the per-board graph store para "consertar" — destruiria todo o KG
do board. Use esta tool em vez disso.

Args:
    board_id: Board UUID específico (mutuamente exclusivo com all_boards)
    all_boards: Se True, migra todos os boards conhecidos do server.
        Default False — exige board_id.

Returns:
    Single board: JSON `{board_id, migrated, columns_added, errors,
    duration_ms}`. All-boards: `{results: [<single>, ...]}`.
    Erro de input: `{error: "missing_board_or_all_boards"}`.

## `okto_pulse_kg_propose_reconciliation`

Compute deterministic ADD/UPDATE/SUPERSEDE/NOOP hints for every candidate.

Rules:
- SHA256 matches last commit → NOOP for all candidates
- Otherwise → ADD with candidate's self-assessed confidence

UPDATE/SUPERSEDE hints will land once the HNSW index is in place.

Args:
    session_id: Session from begin_consolidation

Returns:
    JSON with hints: [ReconciliationHint]

## `okto_pulse_kg_query_cypher`

Execute a read-only Cypher query directly against a board's graph.

Safety rails applied automatically:
- Parser whitelist rejects write keywords (CREATE/DELETE/SET/etc)
- Comment stripping + unicode normalization
- Auto-inject LIMIT if missing; variable-length paths bounded to *..20
- Timeout 5s default, 30s max; rate limit 30 queries/min per agent
- Embedding/vector columns and nested embedding fields are STRIPPED
  from the response (RETURN n / RETURN n.embedding never dump 384-float
  vectors into your context); see response.sanitization.stripped_fields
- Rows are bounded to an agent-safe page; numeric scores are rounded

Args:
    board_id: Board ID
    cypher: Read-only Cypher query string
    params: Optional parameter dict for parameterized queries
    max_rows: 0 = agent-safe default (50). Pass 1..1000 for an explicit
        bounded page; >1000 is rejected (max_rows_exceeds_hard_cap).
    timeout_ms: Timeout in ms (default 5000, max 30000)
    include_working: Optional boolean. Default false enforces canonical-only
        visibility. Pass true to query working + canonical rows during working
        graph validation, rebuild checks, or E2E ingestion tests.

Layer contract:
    Node rows use `graph_layer` as the persisted node property. Do not query
    `kg_layer` on nodes; `kg_layer_counts` appears only in KG health payloads.
    This tool scopes layer visibility with `include_working` (boolean), NOT a
    `graph_layer` selector — the `graph_layer` canonical|working|all selector
    applies to `okto_pulse_kg_query_global` and `okto_pulse_kg_get_related_context`.

Schema-safe queries:
    Properties are NOT universal across labels in semantics — introspect with
    `okto_pulse_kg_schema_info` first and query ONLY the `stable_properties` it
    lists per label (e.g. `id`, `title`, `content`, `graph_layer`,
    `source_confidence`, `relevance_score`). There is no `name` property — use
    `title`. Never assume an ad-hoc property exists on a label.

Returns:
    JSON with rows, row_count, truncated, row_bounds, sanitization,
    execution_time_ms, query_state, canonical_filter_enforced,
    working_omitted_count

## `okto_pulse_kg_query_global`

Cross-board semantic search via the global discovery layer. Returns
matching decisions from all boards the agent has access to, filtered
by ACL.

Args:
    board_id: Optional board_id to restrict search (empty = all boards)
    nl_query: Natural language query string
    top_k: Maximum results (default 10)
    graph_layer: `canonical` (default) | `working` | `all`. Filters which graph
        layer the cross-board search reads. Default `canonical` never leaks
        working nodes; an invalid value fails closed with a structured error.

Returns:
    JSON `{results: [{board_id, id, title, similarity, graph_layer}], count,
    applied_graph_layer}`. `applied_graph_layer` echoes the layer actually
    applied; each result also carries its own `graph_layer`.

## `okto_pulse_kg_query_natural`

Natural language search over the board's knowledge graph. Uses hybrid
search (embedding + HNSW + traversal). Falls back to string match if
embedding is unavailable.

Does NOT invoke any LLM — all processing is deterministic (embedding
model is a local embedding model or stub).

Args:
    board_id: Board ID
    nl_query: Natural language query
    limit: Max results (default 20)
    min_confidence: Min confidence threshold (default 0.5)
    since: Optional ISO-8601 timestamp — return only nodes with
        ``created_at >= since``. Empty string = no lower bound.
        Invalid timestamps are ignored (best-effort).
    until: Optional ISO-8601 timestamp — return only nodes with
        ``created_at <= until``. Empty string = no upper bound.

Returns:
    JSON with nodes, total_matches, optional warning. When a temporal
    filter is active the response also carries ``temporal_filter``
    metadata (candidates_before_filter, filtered_out).

## `okto_pulse_kg_query_reflective`

V1 stub of the reflective retrieve loop (ideação db8e984f).

The full agentic loop (critic_evaluate → dispatch action →
retrieve retry) requires an LLM callable (critic_fn) — MCP
tools can't receive Python callables, so this V1 delegates to
the standard execute_natural_query and labels the response
as a "v1_stub_no_critic_wired" stop reason.

To use the real loop, call
``okto_pulse.core.kg.retrieve_critic.reflect()`` programmatically
from a Python host that wires its own LLM provider.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID (authorization: kg.query.global).
    nl_query: Natural-language query (same as
        okto_pulse_kg_query_natural).
    limit: Max rows (default 20).

Returns:
    JSON with rows + reflection metadata:
    ``{nodes, total_matches, stopped_reason, iterations}``.

## `okto_pulse_kg_schema_info`

Return schema introspection: stable node types, rel types, vector
indexes. Internal types require include_internal=true + admin role.

Args:
    board_id: Optional board ID (empty = global schema namespace)
    include_internal: "true" to include internal types (admin only)

Returns:
    JSON with schema_version, stable_node_types, stable_rel_types,
    vector_indexes, label_properties, optionally internal_*_types.

    `label_properties` (R6-IMP3) maps each canonical node label to its
    `stable_properties` (the schema-guaranteed scalar properties — the SAME set
    on every label, since all node tables share the common attributes) plus
    `has_vector_index`. Query ONLY these stable properties; never assume an
    ad-hoc/universal property. There is no `name` property — use `title`/`content`.
    Use this map to write schema-safe Cypher (okto_pulse_kg_query_cypher).

## `okto_pulse_kg_tick_run_now`

Trigger the KG decay tick manually — gemelar do REST POST /api/v1/kg/tick/run-now.

Dispara um tick imediato sem esperar o cron periódico. Operador agente
chama esta ferramenta quando: (a) acabou de reescalar nodes em massa
e quer scoring fresh imediato, (b) detectou que `default_score_ratio`
está acima de 0.7 e suspeita de stale ranking, (c) está debugando
scoring de um board específico (passe `board_id`).

Use `force_full_rebuild=true` para zerar `last_recomputed_at` antes
do tick (ignora staleness threshold) — útil para boards 0.3.x cujos
nodes herdaram defaults sem benefício do tick. SOMENTE per-trigger;
NUNCA é setting persistido para evitar full-rebuild noturno acidental.

Concurrent calls (cron + manual OU duas chamadas manuais) recebem
erro `tick_already_running` — primeiro a chegar ganha o advisory lock.

Args:
    board_id: Optional board UUID. Empty string = global tick (all boards).
    force_full_rebuild: When true, resets last_recomputed_at to NULL
        for all nodes in scope before the tick — ignores staleness.

Returns:
    JSON with `{tick_id, status: "running", scheduled_at}` on 202 success.
    On 409 (lock held), `{error: "tick_already_running", message: "..."}`.
    On auth failure, `{error: "..."}`.

## `okto_pulse_kg_update_cognitive_pending_item`

KG-03.3 — Mutate exactly one cognitive consolidation item.

Implements api_525a25f1:

    request: board_id, kg_generation_id, item_id, status,
             consolidation_session_id?, reason?, summary_text?
    response (success): board_id, kg_generation_id, item,
                        counts, updated
    errors: unauthorized | item_not_found |
            consolidation_session_required | reason_required |
            invalid_status | unsafe_payload

Invariants enforced BEFORE the storage write:

* br_689bdf14 — ``status=consolidated`` requires a non-empty
  ``consolidation_session_id`` that references a prior
  ``commit_consolidation`` workflow session (ir_d52c3279). The
  MCP write tool only records the reference; the actual cognitive
  KG nodes still flow through the existing seven consolidation
  primitives (``begin_consolidation`` … ``commit_consolidation``).
* br_f9823bad — ``status=skipped`` or ``status=failed`` require a
  non-empty ``reason`` (human-readable, bounded length).
* br_858a0859 — Reject token shapes and oversized narrative
  fields as ``unsafe_payload`` so raw artifact bodies never
  land in the ledger.
* br_d544da65 — Single-item atomic update via
  ``CognitiveConsolidationItemStore.update_item``. Other items in
  the generation remain unchanged and aggregate counts are
  recomputed by the store.

Counter ``kg_cognitive_item_update_total`` (or_174f18d5) emits
exactly one bounded sample per call with labels
``(board_id, target_status, outcome, reason_code)``. Free-text
``reason`` is NEVER labelled; ``reason_code`` is bounded.

## `okto_pulse_kg_rebuild_preflight`

Run the KG rebuild preflight for a board — gemelar do REST POST /api/v1/kg/rebuild/preflight.

Executes the pre-rebuild check (read-only, TR13): enumerates real sources
via BoardSourceStore (the relational store), classifies the KG health state, and persists
the immutable manifest needed for /confirm.

**Admission gate (FR8):** refuses with `rebuild_refused_quarantined` when
`graph_state == 'quarantined'`. `recovery_needed` IS ADMITTED — rebuild is
the prescribed exit from that state (see the stop-rule exception in
`agent_instructions.md`).

**Flow:** call `okto_pulse_kg_health` first. If `overall_state == quarantined`
stop. Otherwise: preflight → confirm → run.

Args:
    board_id: UUID of the board to preflight.

Returns:
    JSON with `outcome`, `action_required`, `base_state`,
    `eligible_source_count`, `preflight_hash`, `manifest_ref`,
    `source_set_hash`. Pass `manifest_ref` + `preflight_hash` to
    `okto_pulse_kg_rebuild_confirm`.

Errors:
    `rebuild_refused_quarantined` — graph is quarantined; use KG reset flow first.
    `preflight_enumerate_failed` — source enumeration failed (detail in response).
    `preflight_service_failed` — preflight service error (detail in response).
    `preflight_manifest_failed` — manifest persistence failed (detail in response).

## `okto_pulse_kg_rebuild_confirm`

Emit the single-use confirmation token for a rebuild — gemelar do REST POST /api/v1/kg/rebuild/confirm.

Loads the manifest persisted in /preflight via `manifest_ref` (NEVER
re-enumerates), verifies that `preflight_hash` matches, and issues the
confirmation token. Pass the token to `okto_pulse_kg_rebuild_run`.

Args:
    board_id: UUID of the board (same used in /preflight).
    operation: Canonical operation (e.g. `'rebuild'`).
    preflight_hash: SHA-256 hex received from /preflight (64 chars).
    manifest_ref: Manifest identifier received from /preflight.

Returns:
    JSON with `confirmation_id`, `manifest_ref`, `source_set_hash`,
    `expires_at`. Pass `confirmation_id` to `okto_pulse_kg_rebuild_run`.

Errors:
    `unsupported_operation` — operation not in canonical set.
    `operation_pending_implementation` — operation valid but not yet implemented.
    `invalid_preflight_hash` — hash format invalid.
    `manifest_not_found` — manifest_ref does not exist on disk.
    `manifest_board_mismatch` — manifest_ref belongs to a different board.
    `preflight_hash_mismatch` — hash does not match manifest binding.
    `confirm_failed` — unexpected error (detail in response).

## `okto_pulse_kg_rebuild_run`

Execute the KG rebuild — gemelar do REST POST /api/v1/kg/rebuild/run.

Consumes the single-use token emitted by `okto_pulse_kg_rebuild_confirm`
and executes the full rebuild under the admin lane KG-01. NEVER mutates
the graph if the token is invalid, the manifest has changed, or the
exclusive lock cannot be acquired.

**Admission gate (FR8):** re-checks quarantine even before consuming the
token. `recovery_needed` IS ADMITTED.

Args:
    board_id: UUID of the board.
    confirmation_id: Token emitted by /confirm.
    operation: Canonical operation (must match /confirm).
    preflight_hash: SHA-256 hex (must match /confirm).
    manifest_ref: Manifest identifier (must match /confirm).
    reason: Human-readable description for audit (max 512 chars).

Returns:
    JSON with `run_id`, `outcome`, `reason`, `audit_ref`,
    `previous_kg_generation_id`, `current_kg_generation_id`,
    `started_at`, `finished_at`, `affected_files`, `report_ref`,
    `report_id`, `publishable_status`, `promotion_outcome`,
    `operator_action`, `event_emitted`.

Errors:
    `rebuild_refused_quarantined` — graph is quarantined; use KG reset flow first.
    `rebuild_run_failed` — unexpected error during rebuild (detail in response).

## `okto_pulse_kg_verify_grounding`

Verify that an agent answer is grounded in the retrieved KG nodes.

Deterministic entity check only in this V1 — matches entity names
against retrieved row titles via normalized exact match (NFKD +
strip diacritics + lowercase) with Jaccard fallback (threshold
0.7). Semantic grounding via LLM is available programmatically
via the Python API `verify_grounding(..., extractor_fn=,
grounder_fn=)` but not exposed over MCP (no LLM wired here).

Ideação d3dfdab8. Enforcement is decoupled — this tool returns
the verdict; the caller (agent, UI, critic loop) decides what to
do with it.

Args:
    board_id: Board ID for authorization (kg.query.global).
    answer_text: The agent's response to verify.
    retrieved_rows_json: JSON string — list of
        `{"node_id": ..., "title": ..., ...}` rows the answer
        was based on.
    pre_extracted_entities_json: Optional JSON array of strings
        listing the entity names the caller wants to check. If
        empty, falls back to heuristic extraction (quoted terms
        and capitalised multi-word phrases).

Returns:
    JSON with the GroundingResult fields: overall_grounded,
    confidence, hallucinated_entities, unsupported_claims,
    attribution_map.

Raises:
    ValueError: if retrieved_rows_json is not valid JSON.
